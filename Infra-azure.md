# Senior DevOps Engineer - Azure Cloud, Network Security & CI/CD

## Overview
A highly skilled **Senior DevOps Engineer** with deep expertise in **Azure cloud services, network security, and CI/CD pipelines** to design and implement robust infrastructure solutions, automate deployment workflows, manage security policies, and optimize cloud-native applications.

## Key Responsibilities & In-Depth Explanations

### **1. Azure Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnets**
- **What it is:** Azure VNet is a fundamental networking component in Azure that allows resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
- **How it works:**
  - Subnets logically divide the VNet for better security and management.
  - **VNet Peering** connects two VNets for private communication.
  - **Private Endpoints** restrict access to Azure services from the VNet.
- **Example Use Case:** A multi-tier application where the database is in a private subnet and the web app is in a public subnet.

### **2. Network Security**
- **Components:**
  - **Azure Firewall**: Centralized security policy enforcement.
  - **VPN Gateways**: Secure communication between on-prem and cloud.
  - **Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: Control inbound/outbound traffic.
  - **DDoS Protection**: Defends against volumetric attacks.
- **Example Use Case:** Implementing NSGs to restrict database access to only web servers and not the internet.

### **3. CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
- **What it is:** GitHub Actions automates software workflows, including testing, building, and deploying code.
- **How it works:**
  - Define **workflows** in `.github/workflows/`.
  - Use **secrets** for secure credential management.
  - Deploy applications using `actions/checkout`, `azure/login`, and `azure/webapps-deploy`.
- **Example Use Case:** Automating deployment of an Azure Static Web App when a push is made to the main branch.

### **4. Azure Functions**
- **What it is:** A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events.
- **How it works:**
  - **Triggers** initiate function execution (e.g., HTTP request, Timer, Queue message).
  - **Bindings** connect to services like CosmosDB, Storage, or Event Hub.
  - **Scaling** is automatic based on demand.
- **Example Use Case:** A function that automatically resizes images uploaded to an Azure Storage Blob.

### **5. Azure Static Web Apps**
- **What it is:** A hosting service optimized for static websites with built-in CI/CD.
- **How it works:**
  - **GitHub Actions** automates deployments.
  - **Custom domains** can be mapped.
  - **Global CDN** ensures fast content delivery.
- **Example Use Case:** Deploying a React front-end app with an Azure Function backend.

### **6. Azure Cognitive Search Service**
- **What it is:** AI-powered search service that indexes and retrieves structured/unstructured data.
- **How it works:**
  - Data is ingested into an **index**.
  - Search queries retrieve relevant results using **AI ranking**.
- **Example Use Case:** Implementing intelligent search in an e-commerce website for product discovery.

### **7. Security Focus**
- **Components:**
  - **Azure IAM (Identity and Access Management)**
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - **Data Encryption (At-Rest & In-Transit)**
  - **Compliance with Standards (ISO, SOC, GDPR)**
- **Example Use Case:** Applying RBAC policies to limit developer access to production resources.

### **8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- **What it is:** Managing infrastructure through code using Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates.
- **Example Use Case:** Automating provisioning of an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using Terraform.

### **9. Collaboration with Cross-Functional Teams**
- **Example Use Case:** Working with developers to optimize microservices deployment in Kubernetes using Helm charts.
